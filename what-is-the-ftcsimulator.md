# What is the FTCSimulator?

**Thanks for showing interest in our simulator!**

The FTCSimulator is a First Tech Challenge robot simulator created by Team 6448 Blue Jays. The FTCSimulator acts as a bridge between the Qualcomm API used by the FTC Android app and the Webots open source robot simulator. Our simulator allows a team to test possible robot designs, add obstacles to simulate a competition game and test logic for both TeleOp and Autonomous. This simulator allows a team to achieve maximum efficiency, allowing a team to test code while the robot is decommissioned.

## Getting Started

We have guides to get started with the simulator to fit your circumstances. You can use either your own Webots world or use ours, and you can either use your own Android Studio code or use our sample one.
