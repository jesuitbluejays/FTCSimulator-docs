# Why use our FTCSimulator?

### Easy to Integrate

Our simulator is built on Webots, an open source robot simulator used by companies like Boston Dynamics and Tesla. It simply bridges your code on Android Studio to Webots. All you need to do is drag in a file or two and edit the configuration file.&#x20;

### Autonomous and TeleOp

Our simulator can simulate both autonomous and TeleOp situations. To change between modes, simply edit the configuration file to specify where your code outputs. Open Source We offer our bridge for free on our GitHub. There, you can also find instructions on how to install. Prerequisites:

* Webots
* Android Studio

### Physics Engine

Webots, an enterprise program used by numerous companies, has a built-in physics engine to properly simulate the behavior of not only your bot but also different objects and game pieces.&#x20;

### Reliable

We used this simulator for years, but we have finally made the decision to make it public for all teams to share the benefit of our robust and accurate robot simulator.
